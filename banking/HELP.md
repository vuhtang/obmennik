## JTE

This project has been configured to use [JTE precompiled templates](https://jte.gg/pre-compiling/).

However, to ease development, those are not enabled out of the box.
For production deployments, you should remove

```properties
gg.jte.development-mode=true
```

from the `application.properties` file and set

```properties
gg.jte.use-precompiled-templates=true
```

instead.
For more details, please take a look at [the official documentation](https://jte.gg/spring-boot-starter-3/).
